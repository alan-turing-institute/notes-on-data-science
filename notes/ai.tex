\title{Artifical Intelligence}
\begin{document}\maketitle

The term ``Artifical Intelligence'' covers at least three different
\emph{categories} of subject:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item:ai-goals} A general \emph{goal}: to make computers that do
  things that require ``intelligence,'' whatever that is. 
\item\label{item:ai-problems} An open set of exemplar \emph{problems}, the
  solution of which one might interpret as requiring intelligence.
\item\label{item:ai-methods} An evolving set of \emph{methods}.
\end{enumerate}

Discussions of AI are prone to ambguity about which category is
meant. Furthmore, most discussion start with category~\ref{item:ai-goals}---which
is rather broad and anyway no-one knows what intelligence is---and move on to
category~\ref{item:ai-methods}, which is rather detailed. I think it might be
helpful to focus on the middle category.

One very broad class of problems is exemplified by noughts-and-crosses (or, if
you like, Connect Four, or chess) and characterised by the property that
everything about the system under study is known. There are only finitely many
possible allocations of a nought, a cross, or a space to nine positions; and in
principle it is straightforward to enumerate all of them. Given such an
allocation, it
