# Automatic Differentation

(Or, differentiable programming)

Parts beyond 1 are not in any particular order

1. Intro
   - Single-variable function defined by composition of builtins.
   - Expression tree "built by hand"
   - Intro to s-expressions?
   
2. Getting hold of the expression tree
   - tracing
   - compiling
   
3. What is differentiation?
   - differential geometry (!)
   - linear maps between tangent spaces
   - Replacing "multivariate functions" with functions from product
     spaces...
	 
4. Wengert tapes, SSA and all that

5. Categorical viewpoint
