* What is a program?

[...]

Let's agree that a program is a thing that takes an input and produces
an output.

Let's suppose we take an extreme stance on this view, and we're only
going to allow ourselves to make programs out of other programs of
this type. And see how far we can get.


* Overview

* Values and their types
** What we know so far

A program turns inputs into outputs.

** Examples

* I.   Product types: A * B
** What we know so far

- ~int~, ~bool~, and ~string~ are types. 
- ~3~ is an ~int~; ~true~ is a ~bool~; ~"Hello"~ is a ~string~

** Making new types



* II.  Function types: A -> B

* III. Sum types: A | B

* IV.  Algebraic data types: int_list and int list

** What we know so far





* V.   Advent of Code

The input is an (~int list) list~.  

#+begin_src ocaml
  type 'a list = Empty
               | Cons 'a * ('a list) 
    
#+end_src

* End

- Values
  - 1, 2, 3, ... : int
  - "hello", ... : string
  - true, false  : bool
